          Search operators can help narrow your search. Many of these can be
          used by selecting options on the Advanced Search page, but using the
          operators directly in the search box may give you additional
          flexibility. Some operators allow you to be more precise in your
          search parameters - for instance, you may specify that results do not
          contain certain words. Some operators can also allow you to be more
          vague in your search parameters - for instance by specifying that all
          matching documents must contain a certain number of some given words.
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          The operators must be typed into the usual search box (the simple
          search box or top search box in the advanced search), and most of them
          can be combined with other search operators.
